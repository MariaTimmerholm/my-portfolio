<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Maria Timmerholm — a curious, positive, and analytical soul. I’m 32 years old, living in Enköping with my husband and our two wonderful young boys.</p>
<p>I have a Master’s degree in Psychology and am currently expanding my expertise through active studies in Digital Design. My passion lies at the intersection of design and 
  human behavior — using insight, empathy, and creativity to craft meaningful user experiences.</p>
<p>Though I work full-time in the public sector, my desire to explore more creative and behavioral-driven projects has taken center stage. 
  This journey reflects a deeper calling — to combine my academic background and personal passion in ways that bring value and innovation.</p>
<p>Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just talk ideas — I'm always open to inspiring conversations.</p>
